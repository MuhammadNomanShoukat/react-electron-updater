## Introduction

The `electron-updater` package allows you to implement automatic and manual update mechanisms in your Electron applications. It supports platforms like GitHub Releases, AWS S3, and custom update servers.

---

## Steps to Integrate

Follow these steps to set up `electron-updater` in your project:

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Ensure `electron-updater` is installed as a dependency in your project.

2. **Set Up Publishing**  
   - Configure your build system (e.g., `electron-builder`) to publish updates to your chosen hosting service (e.g., GitHub Releases).

3. **Initialize AutoUpdater**  
   - Add `electron-updater` to your main process. Ensure it checks for updates when the app starts.

4. **Handle Update Events**  
   - Use `electron-updater` events to monitor update availability, progress, and installation. Notify users about these statuses.

5. **Enable Manual Updates**  
   - Provide users with an option (e.g., a button or menu item) to manually check for updates.

6. **Test the Update Process**  
   - Package and test updates in a staging environment to ensure the mechanism works as expected.

7. **Host and Deploy Updates**  
   - Upload update files to a secure and accessible platform for end users.

## Best Practices

- Ensure your application is **code-signed** to avoid update issues, especially on macOS and Windows.  
- Use **progress notifications** to improve the user experience during update downloads.  
- Regularly test the update flow to identify and fix issues early.  
- Host update files on a trusted and secure platform to prevent vulnerabilities.
